In this notebook, you’ll interact with an intelligent agent designed to help you:\n\n- 🎯 Get clear on your **video topic**, **emotional tone**, and **target audience**\n- ✍️ Craft **attention-grabbing opening hooks** (the first 3–5 seconds of your video)\n- 📊 Score and improve your hook for maximum virality\n- 🔁 Rewrite and explore new angles until it feels *just right*\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 What to Expect\n\n- The assistant will **ask a few quick questions** to learn what your video is about.\n- Once it knows the basics, it will **generate short hook examples**.\n- If the hook doesn’t feel perfect, you can **ask it to try again** with a new style or mood.\n- You'll get clear, strategic advice – in a fast and playful way.\n---\n\n## 📊 About the Dataset\n\nTo help the TikTok Strategist Agent learn from real-world examples, this project uses a [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hoornik/tiktok-sample) of TikTok videos:\n\n```python\ndf = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/tiktok-sample/tiktok_dataset.csv\")\n```\n---\n\n## 🛠️ How to Use This Notebook\n\nThis notebook is designed to **run automatically** from start to finish – no need to type anything unless you want to try your own ideas!\n\n- A **USE_DEMO** flag is enabled by default: you’ll see a sample conversation play out on its own.\n- If you want to interact live, you can toggle \"USE_DEMO\" to **False** (just follow the instructions in the cells).\n- There’s nothing to install – everything runs right here.\n\n---\n\n## 💡 Pro Tip\n\nTikTok success is often about trying *lots* of ideas. Use this tool like a creative partner – bounce ideas, remix tones, and see what grabs your attention. The best hook might be one you didn’t expect!\n\n---\n\n## 🙏 Acknowledgments\n\nThis project was inspired by **[Google 5-Day Gen AI Intensive Course on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn-guide/5-day-genai)**.\n\nSome of the conversational structure, design ideas, and instructional comments were adapted and built upon from their **BaristaBot** notebook in Day 3: Building an Agent with LangGraph.\n\nSpecial thanks to the creators of that course for providing such a clear and accessible foundation to learn from.\n\n---\n\n## 📍 Let’s begin...\n\nThe strategist is ready to help you craft your next viral moment. Let’s make your content trend!\n\nThis agent builds on that knowledge and reimagines it for a creative content generation use case, helping users craft powerful TikTok hooks through iterative coaching.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T22:59:58.803557Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T22:59:58.803843Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T22:59:59.128270Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T22:59:58.803822Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T22:59:59.127506Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"/kaggle/input/tiktok-sample/tiktok_dataset.csv\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Get set up\nStart by installing and importing the LangGraph SDK and LangChain support for the Gemini API.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remove conflicting packages from the Kaggle base environment.\n!pip uninstall -qqy kfp jupyterlab libpysal thinc spacy fastai ydata-profiling google-cloud-bigquery google-generativeai\n# Install langgraph and the packages used in this lab.\n!pip install -qU 'langgraph==0.3.21' 'langchain-google-genai==2.1.2' 'langgraph-prebuilt==0.1.7'","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T23:00:01.371883Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T23:00:01.372617Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T23:00:29.259555Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T23:00:01.372575Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T23:00:29.258503Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"\u001b[33mWARNING: Skipping kfp as it is not installed.\u001b[0m\u001b[33m\n\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m43.5/43.5 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m1.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m138.0/138.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m4.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m42.0/42.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.4/1.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m26.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m00:01\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m433.9/433.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m22.3 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m42.0/42.0 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m47.2/47.2 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m2.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[2K   \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m223.6/223.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m12.7 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n\u001b[?25h","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":2},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Set up your API key\n\nThe `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable can be set to automatically configure the underlying API.
